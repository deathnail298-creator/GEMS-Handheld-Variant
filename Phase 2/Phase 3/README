Phase 3 README — Structure (locked)
1. What Phase 3 Is

Phase 3 = execution and money

This is the only phase where building, testing, simulation-for-implementation, proposals, or deployment are authorized

Everything before this remains non-executable by definition

2. Phase Separation (Hard Restatement)

Phase 0 / 1 = open + bounded

Phase 2 = theory-only (TEL-1.0)

Phase 3 = execution license required

No retroactive permission, no implied rights

This section exists so lawyers stop reading early and nod.

3. What “Commercial” vs “Non-Commercial” Means (License Interpretation)

This is the part you explicitly asked for, and we’ll be very crisp.

Non-Commercial (No Execution License Required):

Reading and internal discussion

Academic critique

Teaching or presentation without implementation

High-level referencing with no build, test, or proposal

Thought exercises and internal evaluation

Commercial / Executable Use (Execution License Required):

Building or prototyping (even internally)

Simulation intended to inform real hardware or operations

Lab testing or field testing

Use in proposals, bids, grants, SBIRs, contracts

Government, defense, or corporate deployment

Integration into any real system

Derivative designs intended for execution

Costed plans or schedules tied to real programs

Plain rule:

If it influences a real decision, budget, proposal, or build — it’s execution.

4. Execution License Summary

Phase 3 execution license = $5,000 USD

One-time execution gate

Authorizes execution only — not ownership

Royalties or scope expansions handled separately if applicable

Written grant only

No numbers beyond the license fee. No promises.

5. Executive Value Breakdown (This Is the “Why Pay” Section)

Executive-facing, not engineering-facing.

Framed as:

cost avoidance

time avoidance

risk compression

No carried-over numbers from other repos.

Language like:

“avoids six-figure early-phase spend”

“front-loads disagreement before capital is committed”

“preserves budget for hardware instead of analysis churn”

This is where we explain that $5k replaces months of internal argument and reinvention, not that it buys a gadget.

6. What This Is Not

Not a technology sale

Not a performance guarantee

Not a turnkey system

Not a consulting engagement

Not a requirement to proceed

This keeps expectations sane.
