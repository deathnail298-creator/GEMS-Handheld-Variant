# 04 — Comparative Archetypes (Phase 2)

## Purpose

This document prevents **category errors**.

Comparative archetypes clarify what this system **resembles**, what it is **often mistaken for**, and what it is **explicitly not**.

Most downstream failure is caused by misclassification rather than poor engineering.

---

## Method

Each archetype comparison follows the same structure:

* **Archetype** — a familiar system or pattern
* **Surface Similarity** — why people conflate them
* **Critical Difference** — the boundary that matters
* **Risk of Confusion** — what goes wrong if mixed

No preference or ranking is implied.

---

## Archetype 1 — Productivity System

**Surface Similarity**
Produces a measurable output or apparent improvement.

**Critical Difference**
Productivity systems exist to *increase throughput*. This system exists to *reduce damage and loss*.

**Risk of Confusion**
If treated as productivity infrastructure, it will be judged against output metrics it was never designed to meet.

---

## Archetype 2 — Active Control System

**Surface Similarity**
Appears to influence environmental conditions.

**Critical Difference**
Active systems require sensing, feedback, and intervention. This system relies on passive interaction and persistence.

**Risk of Confusion**
Expectations of responsiveness, tuning, or optimization create pressure to violate constraints.

---

## Archetype 3 — Consumable Asset

**Surface Similarity**
May degrade over time or be sacrificial.

**Critical Difference**
Consumables are expected to be replaced on schedule. This system is expected to be tolerated indefinitely or ignored.

**Risk of Confusion**
Replacement planning introduces lifecycle management obligations the system was designed to avoid.

---

## Archetype 4 — Mission-Critical Subsystem

**Surface Similarity**
Physically present near mission assets.

**Critical Difference**
Mission-critical systems must never fail. This system is allowed to fail quietly.

**Risk of Confusion**
Once classified as mission-critical, even trivial issues trigger escalation.

---

## Archetype 5 — Experimental Technology Demonstrator

**Surface Similarity**
Novel, unproven, and initially low-impact.

**Critical Difference**
Demonstrators exist to learn quickly and be replaced. This system exists to sit quietly and condition the environment.

**Risk of Confusion**
Pressure to instrument, monitor, or iterate undermines its value proposition.

---

## Archetype 6 — Insurance Infrastructure

**Surface Similarity**
Value is realized primarily when bad things do *not* happen.

**Critical Difference**
Insurance is contractual and financial. This system is physical and environmental.

**Risk of Confusion**
Attempts to demand proof of avoided loss lead to false negatives.

---

## Archetype 7 — Trash Infrastructure

**Surface Similarity**
Simple, cheap, unglamorous, and easy to ignore.

**Critical Difference**
Trash infrastructure is expected to remove waste. This system reduces how bad the waste problem gets.

**Risk of Confusion**
Overpromising cleanup or elimination creates guaranteed disappointment.

---

## Cross-Archetype Observation

The most dangerous misclassification is treating the system as something that must:

* perform on demand
* justify itself continuously
* improve over time

Its strength comes from being **boring, ignorable, and non-authoritative**.

---

## Phase Discipline Reminder

This document:

* does not argue superiority
* does not recommend adoption
* does not define positioning

It exists to stop the wrong mental model from attaching.
