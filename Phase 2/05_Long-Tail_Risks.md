# 05 — Long‑Tail Risks (Phase 2)

## Purpose

This document catalogs **low‑probability, slow‑burn, and delayed‑visibility risks**.

These risks rarely appear in early reviews, rarely trigger alarms, and rarely have clear owners.

They matter because they accumulate quietly.

---

## Definition: Long‑Tail Risk

A long‑tail risk is characterized by:

* low likelihood in any given time window
* high uncertainty in timing
* diffuse or indirect impact
* delayed attribution

These risks are usually invisible until hindsight exists.

---

## Risk 1 — Institutional Memory Loss

**Description**
Over time, original design intent, constraints, and non‑claims are forgotten.

**Manifestation**

* New personnel reinterpret purpose
* Documentation is skimmed, not read
* Informal lore replaces written boundaries

**Consequence**
The system is judged against expectations it was never designed to meet.

---

## Risk 2 — Narrative Drift Through Successive Reuse

**Description**
The system is reused, copied, or referenced in contexts slightly outside its original domain.

**Manifestation**

* Edge cases become anecdotes
* Anecdotes become implied guarantees

**Consequence**
Scope creep occurs without any explicit decision to expand scope.

---

## Risk 3 — Slow Administrative Accretion

**Description**
Incremental oversight, reporting, or coordination requirements accumulate.

**Manifestation**

* One‑off reviews become periodic
* Optional check‑ins become expected

**Consequence**
The system acquires overhead disproportionate to its contribution.

---

## Risk 4 — Deferred Blame Assignment

**Description**
A future problem is retroactively linked to the system.

**Manifestation**

* Correlation is mistaken for causation
* The system becomes a convenient explanation

**Consequence**
Risk ownership is reassigned after the fact, independent of technical reality.

---

## Risk 5 — Metric Contamination

**Description**
Informal or proxy metrics are introduced to "keep an eye on things."\

**Manifestation**

* Metrics are tracked without clear thresholds
* Numbers gain meaning by repetition

**Consequence**
The system is quietly converted into a performance‑managed asset.

---

## Risk 6 — Personnel Turnover Reset

**Description**
Key individuals who understand the system leave.

**Manifestation**

* New stakeholders demand re‑justification
* Historical context is unavailable

**Consequence**
Previously resolved questions are reopened at full cost.

---

## Risk 7 — Legal or Contractual Reinterpretation

**Description**
Over long durations, legal framing evolves.

**Manifestation**

* Terms are re‑read under new policy regimes
* Informal assumptions become formal obligations

**Consequence**
Risk exposure expands without any physical change to the system.

---

## Cross‑Risk Observation

Long‑tail risks are rarely technical.

They emerge from:

* time
* personnel churn
* documentation decay
* institutional incentives

They cannot be engineered away.

---

## Phase Discipline Reminder

This document:

* does not propose controls or mitigations
* does not assess likelihood
* does not recommend monitoring

Its purpose is awareness, not prevention.
