# 06 — Phase Boundary Analysis (Phase 2)

## Purpose

This document defines **where Phase 2 must stop**.

Phase boundaries exist to prevent accidental escalation from reasoning into action. This analysis makes those boundaries explicit and non-negotiable.

Phase 2 is complete when this boundary is respected.

---

## Phase Definitions (Condensed)

* **Phase 0 — Permission to Exist**
  Defines the problem, intent, non-claims, and system boundaries.

* **Phase 1 — Permission to Test**
  Defines bounded prototypes and validation activity.

* **Phase 2 — Permission to Think**
  Explores assumptions, failures, constraints, and risks **without authorizing execution**.

* **Phase 3 — Permission to Execute**
  Defines execution rights, commercial terms, and authorization.

Each phase is legally and conceptually independent.

---

## Hard Stop Rule

Phase 2 ends immediately when any of the following occur:

* A recommendation to build, test, or simulate for implementation
* A proposal of specific design changes
* A suggestion of optimization or improvement pathways
* A definition of readiness, milestones, or schedules
* A request for execution authority

When any of these appear, the work has crossed into Phase 3 territory.

---

## Common Boundary Violations

The following are frequent, unintentional boundary breaches:

* "This could be validated by…"
* "A simple test would show…"
* "The next logical step is…"
* "With minor changes, this could…"
* "This would likely be improved by…"

These phrases convert reasoning into action.

They do not belong in Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 Completion Criteria

Phase 2 is considered complete when:

* Core assumptions have been stressed
* Failure extremes have been explored
* Constraints have been deliberately violated (on paper)
* Misclassification risks have been identified
* Long-tail risks have been cataloged
* No execution guidance exists

Completeness is intellectual, not operational.

---

## Transition Control

Transition out of Phase 2 requires **explicit intent**.

This includes:

* A decision to pursue execution
* Acceptance of execution risk by the licensee
* Agreement to Phase 3 licensing terms

Absent these, Phase 2 remains a closed reasoning space.

---

## Legal Reminder

Phase 2 materials are governed by the **Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)**.

Nothing in Phase 2:

* grants execution permission
* modifies Phase 0 or Phase 1 rights
* authorizes commercial or government use

Execution without a Phase 3 license constitutes a license violation.

---

## Interpretation Rule

When in doubt:

> If it helps someone decide *how* to do something, it is out of phase.

Phase 2 exists to improve judgment, not to advance projects.
