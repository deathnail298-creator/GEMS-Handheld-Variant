Executive / Contractor Appendix
Scope and Intent

This appendix provides high-level commercial context only for the GEMS Handheld Variant. The information below is intended to support executive review and early contractor scoping discussions.

All estimates are coarse, single-point values. No breakdowns, scaling behavior, or optimization assumptions are provided.

This appendix does not authorize development beyond Phase 1.

Phase 1 to Commercialization — Cost Estimate

Estimated total cost (Phase 1 completion to first commercial-ready implementation):
$1.5M USD

This estimate assumes:

Limited engineering refinement

No life-support integration

No flight qualification

Use as an optional peripheral tool

Phase 1 to Commercialization — Time Estimate

Estimated total time (Phase 1 completion to commercial-ready implementation):
18 months

This estimate assumes:

Incremental design refinement

Terrestrial and analog testing

No mission-critical dependency

No certification escalation beyond basic tool handling

Per-Unit Fabricated Cost Estimate

Estimated per-unit fabricated cost:
$25,000 USD per unit

This estimate assumes:

Moderate production volume

Non-exotic materials

Mechanical fabrication only

No flight hardening or space-qualification requirements

Boundary Reminder

These estimates:

Do not imply procurement intent

Do not assume adoption by any agency

Do not reflect flight-ready or mission-qualified hardware

Do not alter Phase 0 or Phase 1 scope boundaries

All values are illustrative and subject to revision under a separate commercial licensing agreement.

Plain-English Summary

This appendix provides rough estimates for cost, timeline, and per-unit price if the handheld tool were developed beyond basic testing. The numbers are high-level only, avoid detailed assumptions, and do not imply approval, adoption, or mission readiness.
