Mission Definition and Non-Claims
Mission Definition

The GEMS Handheld Variant defines a handheld, astronaut-operated interface for removing lunar regolith from external surfaces and routing the captured material into an external GEMS unit.

The mission of this variant is limited to:

Mechanically disturbing and capturing surface dust from suits, tools, or exterior hardware

Providing a sealed routing path from the point of capture to an external GEMS intake

Reducing uncontrolled dust transfer during external operations

The handheld variant does not process regolith and does not alter the behavior, performance, or operating assumptions of the GEMS system. All processing functions remain entirely within the external GEMS unit.

Operating Context

The system is intended for use:

By a human operator

With gloved hands

In external or dirty-side environments only

The handheld unit is treated as a non-essential peripheral tool. Its absence does not degrade EVA capability, habitat safety, or mission success.

Explicit Non-Claims

The GEMS Handheld Variant explicitly makes no claims regarding:

Life-support functionality

Oxygen production, storage, or utilization

Performance metrics, throughput, or efficiency

Continuous or mission-critical operation

Replacement of existing EVA, suit, or airlock procedures

Suitport, habitat, or vehicle integration

Scaling, optimization, or operational cadence

Flight readiness or qualification

No claim is made that use of this system is required, recommended, or preferred for any mission scenario.

Phase Boundary

This mission definition is strictly limited to Phase 0 (Permission to Exist).

The content on this page establishes conceptual intent and system boundaries only. Advancement beyond Phase 0 requires explicit Phase 1 validation and does not imply authorization for further development.

Plain-English Summary

This page defines a handheld tool that captures lunar dust from external surfaces and routes it into an existing GEMS unit without changing how GEMS works. It makes no life-support, performance, or mission-critical claims and is limited to early concept definition only.
