Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 establishes permission to exist for the GEMS Handheld Variant. The criteria below define the minimum conditions required to justify Phase 1 testing.

Success Criteria

Phase 0 is considered successful if all of the following criteria are met:

Clear Mission Definition
The role of the handheld unit as a dust capture and routing interface is explicitly defined and internally consistent.

Boundary Integrity
System boundaries clearly separate handheld responsibilities from GEMS processing, life-support systems, and habitat operations.

Non-Interference with GEMS
The concept demonstrates that captured regolith can be routed to an external GEMS intake without modifying GEMS internals or behavior.

Failure-Benign Design
All identified failure modes are local, non-propagating, and safe to recover from or abandon.

Human-Operated Viability
The architecture supports intuitive operation with gloved hands without reliance on automation or control systems.

Containment Plausibility
The design plausibly supports dust capture and sealed routing without obvious re-aerosolization paths during nominal use.

Testability
The concept can be evaluated using terrestrial testing with lunar regolith simulant and observable outcomes.

Optionality Preserved
The system remains an optional peripheral tool whose absence does not degrade EVA or mission success.

No Certification Escalation
The concept does not introduce new safety-critical certification or approval requirements.

Phase Boundary Enforced
No claims or assumptions extend beyond Phase 0 intent or imply Phase 2+ development.

Phase 1 Authorization

Meeting all Phase 0 success criteria authorizes progression to Phase 1: Permission to Test. Failure to meet any criterion justifies termination without downstream impact.

Plain-English Summary

This page lists the conditions that must be met for the handheld dust-collection concept to move forward into basic testing. The criteria focus on clear boundaries, safe failure behavior, human usability, and avoiding any life-support or mission-critical claims.
