Failure Tolerance Philosophy
Design Intent

The GEMS Handheld Variant is designed to be failure-benign, non-propagating, and human-recoverable. No failure mode may introduce a safety hazard, alter the behavior of the GEMS system, or create operational dependency.

Failure of the handheld unit is considered an acceptable and anticipated outcome.

Core Principles

Failures remain local to the handheld unit.

Failures do not propagate to GEMS, habitat systems, or EVA operations.

Human operators remain fully in control of detection and recovery.

The system may be abandoned without consequence.

Accepted Failure Modes

The following failure modes are considered acceptable and non-hazardous:

Clogging
Dust accumulation may impede flow. The operator may clear the clog manually or discontinue use.

Seal Degradation
Reduced containment efficiency may occur over time. Use may be halted without downstream impact.

Dust Bypass or Leakage
Minor dust release into the external environment is acceptable and bounded.

Mechanical Wear or Damage
Components may degrade, deform, or break during use. Tool usability may be reduced or lost.

Operator Misuse
Incorrect handling results only in reduced effectiveness, not unsafe states.

Explicit Non-Failures

The following conditions are explicitly disallowed:

Introduction of dust into habitat interior volumes

Modification, contamination, or damage to the GEMS system

Creation of a requirement for continuous operation

Dependency of EVA or mission success on tool availability

Failure Response

Failure response is limited to:

Manual clearing

Discontinuation of use

Physical removal or abandonment of the handheld unit

No automated responses, alerts, or recovery systems are required.

Plain-English Summary

This page defines the tool as safe to fail, with all failures confined to the handheld unit and recoverable by simple human actions. If the tool clogs, leaks, or breaks, it can be stopped or abandoned without affecting GEMS, crew safety, or mission operations.
