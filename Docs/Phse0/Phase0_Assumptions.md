Phase 0 Assumptions

The following assumptions define the constraints under which the GEMS Handheld Variant is conceived and evaluated during Phase 0. These assumptions are non-negotiable for Phase 0 and prevent forward-scope bleed.

Operational Assumptions

External Use Only
The handheld unit is operated exclusively in external or dirty-side environments and is not used within habitat interior volumes.

Human-Operated Tool
All operation, monitoring, and recovery actions are performed manually by a human operator.

Gloved Operation
The system is assumed to be used with pressurized EVA gloves and does not require fine motor control.

Intermittent Use
Use of the handheld unit is occasional and task-driven, not continuous or scheduled.

System Assumptions

No GEMS Modification
The external GEMS unit exists independently and requires no modification to support this variant.

Black-Box GEMS Behavior
No assumptions are made regarding GEMS internal design, processing behavior, or output use.

No Power or Data Interfaces
The handheld unit does not require electrical power, data connections, or control systems.

Passive Mechanical Architecture
All functionality is achieved through passive or manually actuated mechanical elements.

Validation Assumptions

Terrestrial Testing Suffices
Phase 1 validation using lunar regolith simulant is sufficient to assess basic feasibility.

Qualitative Evaluation Is Acceptable
Visual observation and simple measurements are sufficient for Phase 1 decision-making.

Scope Assumptions

Optional Peripheral Tool
The system is not required for EVA, habitat operations, or mission success.

No Certification Escalation
The concept does not introduce new safety-critical certification requirements.

Plain-English Summary

This page lists the conditions assumed for the handheld tool, including external use, manual operation, no power or data connections, and no changes to GEMS. These assumptions keep the concept optional, simple, and suitable for early testing only.
