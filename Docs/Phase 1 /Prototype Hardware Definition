Prototype Hardware Definition

This page defines the physical scope of the Phase 1 prototype for the GEMS Handheld Variant. The prototype is intended solely for terrestrial validation and does not represent flight hardware.

Prototype Scope

The Phase 1 prototype is a bench-scale, non-flight, off-the-shelf assembly constructed to validate basic functional behavior.

Included elements:

Intake Head
Representative geometry suitable for mechanical disturbance and dust capture.

Capture / Containment Volume
A simple volume immediately downstream of the intake head to temporarily hold captured material.

Sealed Routing Conduit
Flexible or semi-rigid conduit connecting the handheld unit to a downstream collection container.

Downstream Collection Container
A passive container used to receive routed material and simulate a GEMS intake.

Mechanical Interfaces and Seals
Passive joints, couplings, and seals sufficient to support containment during testing.

Prototype Constraints

The Phase 1 prototype explicitly excludes:

Flight-rated materials or fabrication methods

Environmental hardening (thermal, vacuum, radiation)

Active suction or powered airflow systems

Electronics, sensors, or control logic

Integration with actual GEMS hardware

Life-support or habitat interfaces

Any component selection or fabrication approach is acceptable provided functional intent is preserved.

Acceptable Substitutions

Improvised or surrogate components may be used where appropriate, including:

Commercial hoses or tubing

Off-the-shelf containers

Simple gaskets or sealing materials

Hand-fabricated or 3D-printed parts

Precision, durability, and repeatability are not required beyond what is necessary to observe functional behavior.

Prototype Validity

The prototype is considered valid for Phase 1 testing if:

All functional elements are present

Dust can be captured, routed, and collected

Failures can be observed directly

Prototype failure or damage during testing is acceptable and does not invalidate Phase 1 results.

Plain-English Summary

This page defines a simple, non-flight prototype made from basic materials to test whether the handheld tool can capture and route dust. It avoids flight hardware, electronics, or environmental testing and is only meant for early functional validation.
