Successful Exit Conditions

Phase 1 is considered successfully complete if all of the following conditions are met:

Objectives Addressed
Each Phase 1 objective has been evaluated through one or more defined test modules.

No Mandatory Kill Criteria Triggered
None of the mandatory termination conditions were observed during testing.

Failure Locality Maintained
All observed failures remained confined to the handheld unit and did not propagate to external systems or environments.

Human Operation Viable
The tool can be operated with gloved hands using intuitive actions and reasonable physical effort.

Containment Behavior Acceptable
Dust capture and routing behavior does not produce persistent re-aerosolization during nominal use.

Boundary Integrity Preserved
No results imply modification of GEMS internals, life-support coupling, or operational dependency.

Decision Sufficiency
Collected observations and data are sufficient to support a clear proceed, refine, or terminate decision.

Exit Outcomes

Upon Phase 1 exit, one of the following outcomes is recorded:

Proceed
The concept is viable at a basic level and may be considered for further refinement in a future phase.

Refine
Minor geometry or handling improvements are identified without expanding scope or system boundaries.

Terminate
The concept is closed based on termination criteria or insufficient benefit.

No exit outcome authorizes Phase 2 development, flight qualification, or operational deployment.

Plain-English Summary

This page defines when Phase 1 testing is considered complete and how results are classified. The outcomes allow the work to proceed, be refined, or stop without implying readiness for flight or operational use.
