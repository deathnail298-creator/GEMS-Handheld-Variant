Termination and Kill Criteria

Phase 1 testing for the GEMS Handheld Variant is explicitly structured to allow early termination if fundamental issues are identified. Termination is considered a valid and informative outcome.

Mandatory Kill Criteria

Phase 1 testing shall be terminated if any of the following conditions are observed:

Persistent Re-Aerosolization
Tool operation consistently produces sustained airborne dust clouds that cannot be mitigated through simple geometry or handling changes.

Non-Local Failure Propagation
Any failure mode affects systems beyond the handheld unit or creates uncontrolled dust release outside the immediate operating area.

Seal Failure as Dominant Behavior
Seals fail repeatedly during nominal handling, resulting in uncontrolled leakage that cannot be corrected through basic adjustments.

Irrecoverable Clogging
Clogging occurs frequently and cannot be cleared through simple, intuitive manual actions.

Human Factors Incompatibility
Operation requires excessive force, fine motor control, or awkward postures incompatible with gloved use.

Implicit Dependency Creation
Testing reveals that the tool would need to become operationally required to provide meaningful benefit.

Boundary Violation
Any test outcome pressures expansion into life-support systems, habitat interiors, or modification of GEMS internals.

Discretionary Termination Criteria

Testing may be terminated at the discretion of reviewers or developers if:

Observed benefits are marginal relative to complexity

Tool usefulness overlaps existing procedures without clear improvement

Handling or maintenance burden outweighs convenience

Results do not justify further refinement effort

Termination Outcome

If terminated:

No redesign obligation exists

No follow-on phase is implied

Results remain Phase-1-bounded

Termination is recorded as informative rather than negative

Termination does not imply failure of the GEMS system or existing EVA procedures.

Plain-English Summary

This page lists the conditions under which testing should stop if the handheld tool proves unsafe, impractical, or boundary-breaking. Ending the work at this stage is treated as a valid result and does not imply problems with GEMS or current procedures.
