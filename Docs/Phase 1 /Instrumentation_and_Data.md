Instrumentation and Data

Phase 1 instrumentation is limited to simple, non-intrusive methods sufficient to determine pass/fail outcomes for each test module. Instrumentation supports observation and decision-making, not performance optimization.

Instrumentation Principles

Prefer direct observation over inferred or modeled data

Use off-the-shelf or improvised tools where possible

Avoid precision measurements that imply performance claims

Collect only data necessary to support Phase 1 decisions

Instrumentation by Test Module
Module A — Dust Capture

Instrumentation

Visual observation by operator and observer

Basic mass measurement (pre/post test) using a simple scale

Data Collected

Approximate mass of simulant captured

Qualitative notes on capture behavior

Module B — Routing and Containment

Instrumentation

Visual inspection of joints and seals

Mass measurement of downstream collection container

Data Collected

Presence or absence of leakage (yes/no)

Location of any observed leakage

Approximate mass successfully routed

Module C — Re-Aerosolization Check

Instrumentation

Visual observation of air near intake and operator

Optional low-cost particulate counter, if available

Data Collected

Presence or absence of visible dust clouds

Coarse particulate change near operator (qualitative or approximate)

Module D — Clog and Clearing Behavior

Instrumentation

Operator observation

Simple timing device (stopwatch or equivalent)

Data Collected

Approximate time to clog onset

Time and method required to clear clog

Whether clearing was successful

Module E — Human Factors

Instrumentation

Operator feedback

Optional video recording for later review

Data Collected

Ease of use (qualitative)

Notes on grip comfort, reach, and fatigue

Any handling difficulties observed

Data Recording and Handling

Data is recorded in a simple test log (tables or bullet notes)

No statistical analysis is required

Results are summarized as pass, conditional pass, or fail per module

Data is not extrapolated beyond Phase 1 scope

Explicit Exclusions

Phase 1 instrumentation explicitly excludes:

Environmental modeling

Airflow or pressure characterization

Long-duration endurance metrics

Optimization or scaling analysis

Mission-level interpretation

Plain-English Summary

This page lists the simple observations and measurements used to judge whether the handheld tool works at a basic level. The data collected is intentionally minimal and is used only to decide whether the concept should proceed, be refined, or stop.
