Phase 1 Objectives

Phase 1 establishes permission to test the GEMS Handheld Variant through limited, terrestrial validation. The objectives below define the specific questions Phase 1 testing is intended to answer.

Phase 1 does not evaluate performance optimization, operational deployment, or mission readiness.

Primary Objectives

Validate Dust Capture Feasibility
Demonstrate that lunar regolith simulant can be mechanically captured from representative external surfaces using the handheld intake.

Validate Sealed Routing
Demonstrate that captured material can be routed through a sealed conduit to a downstream collection point without gross leakage.

Assess Re-Aerosolization Behavior
Observe whether tool operation produces visible re-aerosolization of dust during nominal use and basic handling.

Evaluate Clog Behavior
Identify how and when clogging occurs under increased dust loading and whether it can be resolved through simple manual action.

Validate Human Usability
Confirm that the tool can be operated with gloved hands using intuitive motions and acceptable physical effort.

Secondary Objectives

Identify Dominant Failure Modes
Observe which failure modes occur first and how they manifest during use.

Confirm Failure Locality
Verify that failures remain confined to the handheld unit and do not propagate to external systems or environments.

Explicit Exclusions

Phase 1 objectives explicitly exclude evaluation of:

Capture efficiency or throughput

Continuous operation or endurance

Environmental survivability

Mission timelines or procedures

Integration with flight hardware

Life-support interaction or dependency

Phase Boundary

Completion of Phase 1 objectives does not imply readiness for Phase 2, flight qualification, or operational deployment. Results are used solely to determine whether the concept is viable, refinable, or should be terminated.
